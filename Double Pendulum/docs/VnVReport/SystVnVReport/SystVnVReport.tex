This document introduces the result of the system VnV test. 

\section{Functional Requirements Evaluation}
All the functional requirements have been met. 

\section{Nonfunctional Requirements Evaluation}
Generally, all the nonfunctional requirements have been met.

\subsection{Usability}
The system is easy to use, anyone with general computer technology is able to use it. Tested with 5 users, all of them get the output with their own input data. 

\subsection{Correctness and Verifiability}
The outputs generated by Double Pendulum were compared to the $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ graph from \url{https://www.myphysicslab.com/pendulum/double-pendulum-en.html} with the same input data, and the graphs match well. 

\subsection{Maintainability}
The source code was examined by the developer, and ensured that each module only performs one function, makes it easy to maintain.  


\subsection{Portability}
The unit testing has been performed on Mac OS X 10.11 and Windows 10. All functions works on both systems.
	
\section{Comparison to Existing Implementation}	
Compared to the existing implementation\url{https://www.myphysicslab.com/pendulum/double-pendulum-en.html}, Double Pendulum generated the list of $\theta_1(t)$ and $\theta_2(t)$ results, but does not provide animation of the motions, and does not provide as many graphs as the existing implementation\url{https://www.myphysicslab.com/pendulum/double-pendulum-en.html}. 

\section{Unit Testing}
The Unit testing has been done with Unittest in accordance with Unit VnV. The detailed test report can be found at \url{https://github.com/best-zhang-zhi/CAS741Project/blob/master/Double%20Pendulum/docs/VnVReport/UnitVnVReport/UnitVnVReport.pdf}.
